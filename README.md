# Analysing Deep Learning Decoding Methods on Multiple ERP Paradigms

Use DataLoader.py to load ERP CORE BIDS files (https://osf.io/9f5w7/), preprocess them, and save them as a dataframe.
Then use Training.py to initiate and train the Braindecode models. Examples on how to use them are in the DataLoader.ipynb and Training.ipynb notebooks.

The different experiments of the thesis are shown in ModelComparison.ipynb, SubjectAnalysis.ipynb, and FeatureAttribution.ipynb.
